The well-established notion of real vector space defined axiomatically as follows.

A real vector space V is a set equipped with an addition V x V --> V and a scalar multiplication R x V --> V satisfying the following equations:

Associativity: ( x + y ) + z = x + ( y + z )

Action Law 1 : ( lambda mu ) x = lambda ( mu x )

Action Law 2 : 1 x = x

Distributivity : lambda ( x + y ) = ( lambda x ) + ( lambda y )
