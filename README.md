The well-established notion of real vector space defined axiomatically as follows.

A commutative monoid is a set M equipped with a binary operation + : M x M --> M and an element 0 such that

Associativity: ( x + y ) + z = x + ( y + z )

Neutrality: x + 0 = x = 0 + x

Commutativity: x + y = y + x

A real vector space V is a commutative monoid equipped with a scalar multiplication R x V --> V 
satisfying the following equations:

Action Law 1 : ( lambda mu ) x = lambda ( mu x )

Action Law 2 : 1 x = x

DistributivityR2 : lambda ( x + y ) = ( lambda x ) + ( lambda y )

DistributivityR0 : lambda 0 = 0

DistributivityL2 : (lambda + mu) x = (lambda x) + (mu x)

Distributi

In many situations of interest, we do not have a vector space but a notion of space where only barycentric addition is defined.
A typical example is the set of probability distributions on a finite set.
